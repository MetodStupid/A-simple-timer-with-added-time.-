&#9989; C# Unity. This is a simple timer with the ability to add or subtract time for your game. Use it in your
projects, it's
very simple.

&#9989; Note: The stage timer activity will be turned off after the countdown reaches 0.

&#9989; You can experiment and change the required timer data. You can also use any fill-in scale you want.

&#9989; I advise to start the timer from another script, for example the manager.
